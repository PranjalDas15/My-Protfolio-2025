  "I'm a Computer Science Engineering graduate from Assam Down Town University, and I discovered my love for coding a bit laterâ€”around the 7th semester of my college journey. What began as curiosity quickly turned into a deep interest in web development. Since then, I've immersed myself in building full-stack applications using technologies like React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB. I'm focused on sharpening my skills and looking for opportunities to grow as a developer, contribute to meaningful projects, and keep learning.";
